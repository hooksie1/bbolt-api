= Overview

https://github.com/hooksie1/bbolt-api[Bbolt API^] is a simple REST API for interacting with BoltDB. The server looks for an environment variable named `DATABASE_PATH` and an environment variable named `SERVER_PORT`.

The server only opens one database. The server is lightweight, so if you need more than one database you can just run another server.


== Docker
`docker run -d --name api -v bolt-volume:/database -p 8080:8080 hooksie1/bbolt-api:v0.0.4`

The container automatically stores the database named `bolt.db` in `/database`.
